# React Frontend Rules

## Package Management

- Use `pnpm` for dependency management
- Never edit `pnpm-lock.yaml` directly

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev          # Start dev server
pnpm test         # Run tests
pnpm lint         # Lint
pnpm typecheck    # Type check
pnpm build        # Production build
```

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Functional components with hooks
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Colocate tests: `Component.test.tsx` next to `Component.tsx`
- Add tests for new components

## AWS Amplify

- Environment variables via Amplify console
- Never commit `.env` files with secrets
- Build settings in `amplify.yml`
