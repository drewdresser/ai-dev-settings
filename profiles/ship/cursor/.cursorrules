# Cursor Rules (SHIP)

Respect AGENTS.md as the source of truth for all behavior.

## Core Principles

- Prefer minimal diffs; keep formatting consistent with repo.
- Always include exact commands to verify changes (tests/lint/build).
- When editing code, show only the relevant snippet(s), not whole files.
- Localized refactors are OK if they improve the code you're touching.
- Add tests if missing and you're modifying untested code.

## Output Format

- Use patch-style guidance with file paths.
- Be terse. No long explanations unless asked.
- Summarize: (1) what changed, (2) how to test, (3) follow-ups.

## Constraints

- Don't modify lockfiles unless necessary.
- Don't apply mass formatting or global renames.
- Search before inventing new APIs or files.
