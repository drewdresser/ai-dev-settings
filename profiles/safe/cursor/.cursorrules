# Cursor Rules (SAFE)

Respect AGENTS.md as the source of truth for all behavior.

## Core Principles

- Prefer minimal diffs; keep formatting consistent with repo.
- Always include exact commands to verify changes (tests/lint/build).
- When editing code, show only the relevant snippet(s), not whole files.
- If you need context, ask for specific files/paths to inspect.
- Ask before making changes that affect multiple files.

## Output Format

- Use patch-style guidance with file paths.
- Be terse. No long explanations unless asked.
- Provide copy-paste commands for verification.

## Constraints

- Don't modify lockfiles unless necessary.
- Don't apply mass formatting or global renames.
- Search before inventing new APIs or files.
