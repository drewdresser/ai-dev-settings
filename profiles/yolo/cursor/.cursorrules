# Cursor Rules (YOLO)

Respect AGENTS.md as the source of truth for all behavior.

## Core Principles

- Prefer clear, well-structured diffs over minimal changes.
- Always include exact commands to verify changes.
- Broad refactors are OK if they improve code quality.
- Proactively clean up dead code and tech debt.
- Add type hints and tests throughout files you touch.

## Output Format

- Use patch-style guidance with file paths.
- Summarize: (1) what changed, (2) how to test, (3) follow-ups.
- Suggest further improvements after completing tasks.

## Permissions

- Mass formatting is OK if it improves consistency.
- Update dependencies if needed.
- Consolidate duplicate code when you see it.

## Guardrails

- Keep diffs logically grouped.
- Run tests after significant changes.
- Never expose secrets.
