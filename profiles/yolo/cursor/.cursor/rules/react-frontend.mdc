# React Frontend Rules

## Package Management

- Use `pnpm` for dependency management
- Update dependencies proactively if beneficial

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev              # Start dev server
pnpm test             # Run tests
pnpm test --coverage  # Run with coverage
pnpm lint --fix       # Lint and fix
pnpm typecheck        # Type check
pnpm build            # Production build
```

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Functional components with hooks
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Colocate tests: `Component.test.tsx` next to `Component.tsx`
- Use React Query or similar for data fetching
- Proactively refactor for clarity

## AWS Amplify

- Environment variables via Amplify console
- Never commit `.env` files with secrets
- Build settings in `amplify.yml`
- Keep infrastructure in sync with application
